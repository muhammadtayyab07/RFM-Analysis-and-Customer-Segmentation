RFM (Recency, Frequency & Monetary) analysis:
“is a behavior based technique used to segment customers by examining their transaction history.” 

  ->It is based on the marketing axiom that 80% of your business comes from 20% of your customers.
  ->The 80-20 rule maintains that 80% of outcomes (outputs) come from 20% of causes (inputs). In the 80-20 rule, you prioritize the 20% of factors 
  that will produce the best results. A principle of the 80-20 rule is to identify an entity's best assets and use them efficiently to create maximum value.

Key RFM Metrics:

  1.Recency (How recently a customer has purchased?)

  2.Frequency (How often do they purchase?)

  3.Monetary (How much the customer spends?) 

Performing RFM ANALYSIS in R language:
1- Load the libraries in R studio:
library(tidyverse)
library(Hmisc)
library(janitor)
library(plotly)

2- Load dataset in R in the environment section. You can do this by first setting your working directory in R (where dataset is stored ) than using 
csv function to read. A short cut to add your current working directory id by pressing: Shift+Ctrl+H 

3- To view your dataset : view(sales_data)
The first thing to do with your data is to understand it, by looking at this dataset what comes in mind? No idea! Don't worry. It's a sales data of a store. 
The rows/observations in this dataset, is the combination of an InvoiceNo and a StockCode , but wait , analysis of this dataset would be hectic, so first we 
would do a bit cleaning by summarizing the distinct InvoiceNo to a unique one as it has spread our data out.

 RFM ANALYSIS Steps:

1 - As mentioned above , first step is to collect data from the database of your client that, is showed above in the from of collected dataset. 

2 - Second step is to calculate RFM Metrics which have already been defined above. In R we use the code that is provided in the repository 
to calculate these metrics. 

 Functions used in code and their description:

   mutate: to add new column.
   subtotal: to calculate purchase amount by invoice ( not a function but another column)
   strptime: R by default treat every character as string , strptime function is used to tell R to treat InoiceDate column as numeric also by specifying format.
   group_by : is used to view other variables according to specific one. In our case, as RFM is customer based analysis we group by Customer_ID
   summarize: to summarize data , we've calculated recency as days_since_last_purchase, frequency as n_transactions and monetary value as total_revenue.
   max: is used to calculate last_purchase_date
   difftime: is used to calculate recency as days_since_last_purchase by putting in date_today(analysis date) , last_purchase_date and units = "days" as,
   recency is defined: How recently a customer has purchased?
  The above steps then stored as df_rfm_1

3 -  Next comes RFM Scoring, which is done in two steps:

   -> Assigning bins to customers or make RFM quintiles , Why we do this? let's say in the total revenue section , the customers revenue distribution would be like:
   someone spent $10, another one $50, $100, $250, $500, $700, and so on.. So, it wouldn't be wise or even impractical to analyze each and every one besides we bin them,
   so that every bin/quintile would be the representative of chunk of customers fall within specific monetary value and can be treated accordingly, same goes for other two metrics. 
  
   In R we did it using cut2 function and the results is stored as df_rfm_2
   
   -> Assign scores to these bins, which is simply like marking test scores of a class in the school, the customer with rfm score of etc would be this(segment name) and with rfm score
   of etc would be that (segment name).
   In R we did it using as.integer function and dense_rank for recency metric and stored the result as df_rfm_3.

4 -  Now comes the final step where we define segments and segment customers based upon their RFM score.

  A segment must contain following details:

   the name of the segment
   the definition of the segment
   the intervals for the recency, frequency & monetary scores

  In R, we use ifelse condition to label the customers by defined segment and result is stored as df_rfm_4
  and then finaly visulize it using ggplot.
